!!! PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT !!!

There is no reason you should alter either 1_1_Feature_Selection_Code.R and 1_2_Feature_Seleciton_Environment.RData.
The only reason they are used is to generate the 20 Most Important Features.

Learn to save and load your environments. If it takes 8 hours to run a command and you don't save the environment.
You have to use 8 more hours to do it again.

You can copy 2_1_Default_Code.R and 2_2_Default_Environment.RData. To start training your models.
Copy and Rename the two files based on your portion of the project.

1_1_Feature_Selection_Code.R

    This is the code I used to find the 20 most important features.
    This took 8 days, 14 hours (206 hours) to complete and create the 1_2_Feature_Seleciton_Environment.RData

1_2_Feature_Seleciton_Environment.RData

    This is the environment data created by 1_1_Feature_Selection_Code.R

2_1_Default_Code.R

    This is the default code for everyone's projects. It has columns totaling zero remove and the 10 most important features selected.

    I selected the Top 10 Most Important Features.
    This was done in an effort to save processing time.

2_2_Default_Environment.RData

    This is an enivornment created from 2_1_Default_Code.R.
    This isn't needed the environment only takes seconds to finish. It is here to be consistant.

3_1_SVM_Code.R

    This is the code for generating the SVM Model.

3_2_SVM_Environment.Rdata

    This is the environment created by 3_1_SVM_Code.R.
